                            Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK) is a corneal transplant procedure that uses the 
                            working corneal endothelium of a donor to help correct vision loss. Though 
                            uncommon, it has the potential danger of having the recipient eye reject 
                            the donor graft, resulting in possible infection, swelling, or hemorrhage. Consequently, it 
                            is necessary for physicians to monitor patients for any signs of graft 
                            rejection up to a year (or more) after surgery. 
                        </p>

                        <p> <b> Project Goals & Dataset </b> <br/> 
                        
                            We collaborated with <a href="https://www.niios.com/niios/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dr. Gerrit Melles of the NIIOS institute </a> in figuring out a way to detect
                            graft rejection in post-DMEK patients as early as possible, as the traditional montitoring 
                            process requires monthly check-ups for up to a couple of years. This is because graft rejection 
                            tends to be quite slow to show signficant symptoms, and is often quite individualistic to the
                            patient itself. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            As Dr. Melles is one of the primary 
                            corneal surgeons for DMEK surgery, he provided us with time series endothelial images
                            from some previously diagnosed DMEK patients, including their ultimate status on rejection. 
                            The goal was to utilize various machine learning techniques on this data set
                            to hopefully develop a faster and reliable approach to DMEK rejection.

                            <b> Approach #1: CNNs & Transfer Learning </b> <br/>

                                As the data set compromised of limited, classified images, transfer learning was employed on 
                                various convolutional neural networks, focusing on freezing the more universal bottom layers
                                and then retraining the upper layers to the dataset. This was used in conjunction with 
                                hyperparameter tuning, gradient descent, and k-fold cross validation to optomize accuracy while minimizing 
                                overfitting. 
                                <br/><br/>
                                Best results given by a retrained VGG16 model, outputting a general classification accurracy 
                                of 75%. 

                            <br/><br/>
                            <b> Approach #2: Image Segmentation & Cell Analysis </b> <br/>

                                U-Net architecture in conjunction with python's CV2 library for post-processing was utilized to 
                                conduct image segmentation, extracting individual cell contours from a given image as a 
                                vectorized array. Various attributes of the cellular data were then chosen, notably size, shape,
                                and elongation, quantified, and then analyzed for statistically significant deviance from the comparative
                                classification group. Graphical time series were also plotted to help determine visual cues on 
                                differences among the patients, an attempt to establish a threshold for rejection. 
                                <br/><br/>
                                In general, rejected patients were noticed to show an increasing trend in shape, elongation, and 
                                particularly size; however, a threshold was difficult to determine into a shortened time frame 
                                as the starting points of patients showed enough overlap. Rejected patients also showed much more 
                                turning points and oscillation in their plotted time series than their non-rejected counterparts; however, 
                                a concrete threshold was again difficult to establish as rejected patients tended to have much more 
                                data/data points available. 

                            <br/><br/>
                            <b> Approach #3: Cell Data & Machine Learning </b> <br/>

                                Extracted cellular charachteristics for all datasets from the second approach were now fed into various 
                                machine learning models. This included clustering models like K-Means and DBSCAN, classification models
                                like SVMs and Linear Regression, and ensemble methods like Random Forest Classifer. Hybrid models
                                were also attempted with both the cellular data and CNN predictions. 
                                <br/><br/>
                                However, this approach ultimately led to multiple dead ends. Cellular charachteristics were too limited
                                in scope, and would have been better suited in conjunction to time-series models - not independent 
                                classification models.
