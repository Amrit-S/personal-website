                Collaborated with the Visualizations and Composite Management team to redesign a web based error report for an internal HMI tool, 
                receiving extremely positive feedback on final product from in-house engineers. Developed a highly customizable and dynamically generated single page web 
                application using .NET, jQuery, and Bootstrap under Agile Scrum. Abstracted testing suite and refactored 300+ HMI tests in C# for 
                improved clarity and context, providing extensive SWE documentation detailing codebase changes.

                Joined as a front-end developer on an android application targeted to supplement testing analysis using a lab-made 
                Glaucoma biomedical device. Later worked as a lead researcher on a machine learning project focused on early detection
                of DMEK corneal graft rejections, utilzing image segmentation, time series analysis, and transfer learning on the
                VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network. Designed and developed a <Link className="section-link" to="DMEK-Project" spy={true} smooth={true} duration={500} > web application </Link> 
               that packages the aforementioned research
                into a usable tool for DMEK physicians to aid in graft rejection diagnosis.
